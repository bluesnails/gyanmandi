Sun Tzu had said, "If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle." 
</p>

<p>Prepare for GS like never before. 
Have all your bases covered. 
Your enemies in the battle of GS are not other aspirants, 
your enemies are your weaknesses that come and bite you where your armour is weak.</p>
</p>

<p>
Learn how your weakness is spread across the subjects, 
correct them and conquer your enemies. 
This is not the ultimate guide to reaching your goals.
You have to put in the hard work. 
There is no substitute for it. 
You just have to do it. 
This is not a drill.
</p>

<p>
Made by aspirants for aspirants. Let this be the One place to rule them all.
